finchd's ansible-scripts
========================

Everybody has a script staging repo, this one's mine.
Place for one-liners and single-purpose playbooks. Playbooks may get turned into modules or roles as they grow in complexity, but templates/patterns should remain here

install_single_scripts_from_github.yaml
     single task to get_url from a github commit, possibly add simple version checking later - this shall not grow to be my own package manager!
